    <h2>About European Art Cinema</h2>
    <p>European art cinema was popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Based on a rejection of the tenets and techniques of classical Hollywood cinema, it produced some of cinema's most impactful directors and films.</p>
    <p>It is typical of the films of European art cinema that a cause and effect driven narrative, as well as a goal-oriented protagonist, are not implemented. Classical Hollywood cinema follows a clear narrative path, the goal being to fully absorb the audience for the purpose of entertainment. In contrast, directors of European art cinema tend to employ ambiguous, open-ended plots. Their camera techniques often cause the audience to be aware they are watching a film. This encourages the audience to ask questions of both the film and life, bringing the audience closer to "truth".</p>
